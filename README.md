 I really excited to share my first SQL project regarding pizza sales to extract insights from data through sql queries from simple to advance. The desired outcomes from this project are the follwing.
1 top selling pizza
2 Total revenues generated from pizza sales
3 The highest priced pizza
4 Top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue
5 percentage distribution of each pizza types against revenue
6; Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza 
 types based on revenue for each pizza category
Total four tables used in this project and using advanced queries
like aggregate functions, window functions, group by and subqueries.
